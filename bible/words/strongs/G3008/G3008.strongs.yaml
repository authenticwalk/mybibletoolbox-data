  definition: '<b>λειτουργέω</b>, -ῶ<BR /> (λειτουργός), [in LXX chiefly for שָׁרַת
    pi., also for עָבַד, צָבָא, etc. ;] <BR />__1. in cl., at Athens, to supply public
    offices at one''s own cost, render public service to the State, hence, generally,
    <BR /> __2. <b>to serve the State, do a service, serve </b>(of service to the
    Gods, Diod., i, 21): of the official service of priests and Levites (<ref=''Exo.29.30''>Exo.29:30</ref>,
    <ref=''Num.16.9''>Num.16:9</ref>, <ref=''Sir.4.14''>Sir.4:14</ref>, <ref=''1Ma.10.42''>1Ma.10:42</ref>,

    see), prop., to serve for hire, LXX (as some­times in cl.), always of service
    to the deity on the part of both priests and people (<ref=''Exo.4.3''>Exo.4:3</ref>,
    <ref=''Deu.10.12''>Deu.10:12</ref>, and similarly in NT). λειτουργέω "is the fulfilment
    of an office: it has a definite representative character, and corresponds with
    a function to be discharged". It is therefore used of serving in an office or
    ministry: in LXX always of priests and Levites, in NT, with its cognates (<ref=''Rom.13.6;
    15.27''>Rom.13:6 15:27</ref>, are not really exceptions), of services rendered
    either to God or man by apostles, prophets, teachers, and other officers of the
    church (cf. Tr., <i>Syn.</i>, § xxxv; <i>ICC</i> on <ref=''Rom.1.9''>Rom.1:9;</ref>
    Westc., He., 232 ff.) </re> (AS)'
