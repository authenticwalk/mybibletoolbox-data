strongs_number: G4496
language: greek
lemma: ῥίπτω
transliteration: rhíptō
definition: to fling (properly, with a quick toss, thus differing from G906 (βάλλω),
  which denotes a deliberate hurl; and from (see in G1614 (ἐκτείνω)), which indicates
  an extended projection); by qualification, to deposit (as if a load); by extension,
  to disperse
kjv_usage: cast (down, out), scatter abroad, throw
derivation: a primary verb (perhaps rather akin to the base of G4474 (ῥαπίζω), through
  the idea of sudden motion);
