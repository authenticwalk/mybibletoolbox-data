  definition: '<b>οἰκία</b>, -ας, ἡ<BR /> (οἶκος), [in LXX chiefly (very freq.) for

    <BR /> <re><i>SYN.</i>: οἶκος, which in Attic law denoted the whole estate, οἰκία,
    the dwelling only. In cl. poets οἶκος has also the latter sense, but not in prose,
    except in metaphorically usage, where it signifies both property and household.
    The foregoing distinction is not, however, consistently maintained in late Greek;
    cf. MM, ii, xvii, and see Thayer, see word οἰκία </re> (AS)'
