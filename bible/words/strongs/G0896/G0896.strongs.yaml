extended_definition:
  gloss: Baal
  definition: '<b>Βάαλ</b> (Rec. βαάλ), ὁ, ἡ, indecl. (Heb. בַּעַל, <b>lord</b>),
    <BR /> <b>Baal</b>: <ref=''Rom.11.4''>Rom.11:4</ref> (LXX). The fem. art. here
    agrees with the usage of LXX, where, following a similar Hebrew practice (בֹּשֶׁת
    for בַּעַל), αἰσχύνη appears to have been substituted in reading for the written
    Βάαλ (cf. <ref=''1Ki.18.19''>3Ki.18:19</ref>), and to account for the frequently
    use of the fem. art. bef. Β. The usage, however, is not general, and in the passage
    cited in Ro (<ref=''1Ki.19.18''>3Ki.19:18</ref>), LXX reads τῷ Β. † <BR /> (AS)'
