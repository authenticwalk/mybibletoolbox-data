    /> <re><i>SYN.</i>: τιμωρία, requital. Arist. distinguishes between κ . as that
    which, being disciplinary, has reference to the sufferer, and τ. as that which,
    being penal, has reference to the satisfaction of him who inflicts (see Thayer,
    see word κ., and cf. Tr., <i>Syn.</i>, § vii). But in late Gk. especially, the
    distinction is not always maintained (see reff. in Thayer) </re> (AS)'
